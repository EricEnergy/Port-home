 <p> I am originally from orlando florida home of one of Disneys feature animation studios. At an early age my father who was an animator brought home photoshop and since then I have been on a 
 path of creativity ever since. Ive done everything from photography, graphic design, and not my new endevor to become a full stack web developer. </p>
 
 <p> When I am not at home working on something art related I enjoy playing my favorite game online called Rocket Leauge, long boarding, playing guitar, or going out to a new fancy place to eat with my wife.</p>
 
 <p>ANother thing I enjoy doing is spending time with my various types of animals. I have two huskies, a cat, 3 snakes and nine tarantulas.</p> 

 <p> With any projects I work on, there is a little piece of myself.  </p>
